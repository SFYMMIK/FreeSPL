no readme cuz i hate markdown.
you can find the guide of syntax in the syntax.md file
# lil readme and syntax.md update
## readme update:
### i have been trying to develop this language but i just imagined what would be the future of this project, not only would i face difficulties which might be too difficult for me but also i just thought of the general future of the language like i was thinking, why am i even doing this?, there is a lot of better and faster languages for programming so why create my own?, even tho no one will use this language or even develop it with me, i am all alone in this situation.

## developing difficulties:
- Parser Expansion: As I add more complex language features, I might struggle with keeping the parser efficient and modular. New syntax rules could conflict with existing ones, leading to edge cases that break functionality.
- Runtime Stability: Handling complex runtime features like concurrency or error management could be tough, especially without creating performance bottlenecks.
- Memory Management: Managing memory efficiently in the C core, while preventing leaks, would be crucial as the project scales.
- Cross-Language Features: Balancing Go and C implementations might cause integration challenges, especially in handling error reporting and debugging across both environments.
- Extensibility: As I add more features, ensuring the language remains flexible but simple might be challenging, especially if developers with different needs would start using it.

## syntax.md update:
## little update to the syntax has been commited

# And as of now, i am archiving this project and wont be developing it, but still will be looking for other program ideas.
