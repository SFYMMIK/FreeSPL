# FreeSPL
is a modern approach at connecting pythom + go + C syntax for fast coding, it is a not complex project made for fun, if you want you can take it seriously or you dont have to, FreeSPL is designed to give you compatibility with assembly + you can make .splh libraries for FreeSPL in assembly that way in the future

## main update:
- added input + loops + breaks + trying to add assembly compatibility and freespl libraries
- fix some things
- some errors will appear sometimes which do nothing
- the newly added input is till broken where it prints only one word

## lil update to example.spl:
- just more things in it like yk input n shit

> [!WARNING]
> FreeSPL-stable is right now a interpreted language but will stay that way for now because its easier to develop

# How to use:

```sh
./freespl <input_file.spl> 
```
